title: Learning Tips
---

I recently took a short online course on Coursera: [Learning how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/course/learning). The roughly 20 hours I put into this course might well be the best investment of my time to date. I now understand better how our brain works. In addition, the course also taught me a bunch of useful techniques to learn more effectively.

In this post, I'll summarize three concepts that have changed my way of thinking about our brain.


## Focused and diffuse thinking modes

The focused thinking mode should not be a stranger to anyone. When someone says "I'm working hard on a problem", they usually refer to this mode of thinking.

The focused thinkind mode helps us examine the problems with the tools we know best: critical thinking and analysis, logical reasoning and what have you. The focused mode works well for the problems that we know how to solve, e.g. problems that don't necessarily present a learning opportunity.

In the [course](https://www.coursera.org/course/learning), Dr. Oakley suggests that there's another mode of thinking: the diffuse mode. You enter this mode of thinking when you relax and let your mind wander freely.

In this diffuse mode of thinking, your mind broadens its horizon and taps into the full power of your memory. This mode of thinking is much less disciplined but not less powerful than the focused mode. Personally, my more creative solutions to tough programming problems often come unexpected; such as after a good rest, or a while walking and thinking about the problem absent-mindedly. I can now more accurately attribute this phenomenon as the result of the diffuse thining mode.

The trick to better problem solving is a good balance between the two modes of thinking. Day dreaming all the time without a good grasp of the problem usually doesn't lead anywhere. On the contrary, doggedly trying to solve a problem only in the focused mode does not utilise all the capabilities of your brain. Try to alternate between the two modes and find a method that works for you.



## Procrastination

Everyone procrastinates to a certain degrees. There are always unpleasant tasks that you don't want to start, like taking out the trash or studying a particular subject. There are things you know you *should* do, but lack the courage to begin. 

Procrastination is a natural defense mechanism of your brain against unpleasant activities. However, if left unchecked, procrastination can negatively impact your life in many ways. Understanding and knowing how to deal with procrastination are, for me, one of the most important skills a person can have.

The mechanism behind procrastination is surprisingly simple. The area that triggers procrastination is the same brain region that detects pain. In order to avoid that painful feeling of starting something unpleasant or difficult, your brain comes up with a simple tactic: do something easier, and get an immediate reward out of it. From another angle of view, procrastination shares many [traits](https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/addiction) with [addiction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction).

There are four components to procrastination:

1. The cue
2. The routine
3. The reward
4. The belief

If you wish to know more about these components, I invite you to view the [lectures](https://class.coursera.org/learning-003/lecture/51) by Dr. Oakley who did an excellent job at explaining the concept in an easy-to-follow manner.

I do want to touch on item #4 of procrastination: **the belief**. The procrastination process can only work reliably if it's sustained by an underlying belief. If you're telling yourself, consciously or not, that "I'm no good at starting new things" or "I'll never get through this chapter of the book", you help to fuel the belief that sustains the procrastination behavior.

There are a few simple but effective techniques to help you combat procrastination:

* Know that the pain you experience when starting something is only temporary. In fact, as you get into the flow of learning something new, the whole process can become quite enjoyable.
* Do not focus on the product, or the outcome, of a task. Focus instead on the process. Recently I decided to finally jump in and study Haskell. The product itself, the [Haskell programming language](https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell) was quite daunting and it took me a long time to start. However, once I focused instead on reading [Learn Yourself A Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) a chapter at a time, I finally managed to get moving ahead.
* The [Pomodoro technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a helpful method to get you started. The core idea is to fix a 25 minutes block of time exclusively for a task. You *must* stop after the 25 minutes interval and give yourself a break or some other reward.
