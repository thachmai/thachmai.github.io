I recently took a short online course with a strange title: [Learning how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/course/learning). The roughly 20 hours I put into this course might well be the best investment of my time to date. In this post, I'll summarize three key concepts that have changed my way of thinking about our brain works.

### Focused and diffuse thinking modes

The focused thinking mode should not be a stranger to anyone. When someone says "I'm working hard on a problem", they usually refer to this mode of thinking.

The focused thinkind mode helps us examine the problems with the tools we know best: critical thinking and analysis, logical reasoning and what have you. The focused mode works well for the problems that we know how to solve, e.g. problems that don't necessarily present a learning opportunity.

In the [course](https://www.coursera.org/course/learning), Dr. Oakley suggests that there's another mode of thinking: the diffuse mode. You enter this mode of thinking when you relax and let your mind wander freely.

In this diffuse mode of thinking, your mind broadens its horizon and taps into the full power of your memory. This mode of thinking is much less disciplined but not less powerful than the focused mode. Personally, my more creative solutions to tough programming problems often come unexpected; such as after a good rest, or a while walking and thinking about the problem absent-mindedly. I can now more accurately attribute this phenomenon as the result of the diffuse thining mode.

The trick to better problem solving is a good balance between the two modes of thinking. Day dreaming all the time without a good grasp of the problem usually doesn't lead anywhere. On the contrary, doggedly trying to solve a problem only in the focused mode does not utilise all the capabilities of your brain. Try to alternate between the two modes and find a method that works for you.



### Procrastination

Procrastination is an old friend of mine, and what I learned in the course resonates strongly with my personal experience.

Procrastination begins as a defense mechanism of the brain against unpleasant activities.
