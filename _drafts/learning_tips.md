I recently took a short online course with a strange title: [Learning how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/course/learning). The roughly 20 hours I put into this course might well be the best investment of my time to date. In this post, I'll summarize three key concepts that have changed my way of thinking about our brain works.

### Focused and diffuse thinking modes

The focused thinking mode should not be a stranger to anyone. When someone says "I'm working hard on a problem", they usually refer to this mode of thinking.

The focused thinkind mode helps us examine the problems with the tools we know best: critical thinking and analysis, logical reasoning and what have you. The focused mode works well for the problems that we know how to solve, e.g. problems that don't necessarily present a learning opportunity.

In the [course](https://www.coursera.org/course/learning), Dr. Oakley suggests that there's another mode of thinking: the diffuse mode. You enter this mode of thinking when you relax and let your mind wander freely.

In this seemingly unproductive mode of thinking, your mind is free to use its vast memory reservoir and make random connections to solve the problem for you subconsciously.


### Procrastination

### Memory
