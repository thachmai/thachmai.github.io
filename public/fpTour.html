        <h1>The Current King: Object-Oriented, Imperative paradigm</h1>
        Java (1996) was the first popular "pure OO" language<br/>
        The main focus is the object: <b>data + state + method</b><br/>
        Program execution is often viewed as a sequence of steps<br/> 
        The "current step" jumps between object boundary<br/>
        <br/>
        Techniques: design patterns, SOLID, principle of least knowledge<br/>

        <h1>The Landscape Is Changing</h1>
        C# introduced LINQ (2007)<br/>
        Scala (2004) and Clojure (2007) got a foothold in the JVM world<br/>
        Go-lang did away with object altogether (2009)<br/>
        Java introduced "lambda" in Java 8 (2014)<br/>
        Javascript formalised the Promise specification (2015)<br/>
        Perl 6 (2015) can do functional programming<br/>
        <br/>
        Ideas from Functional Programming (FP) are affecting us in substantial ways<br/>

    <section>
        <h1>A Brief History of FP</h1>
        An ancient idea, started with lambda calculus by Alonzo Church in the 1930s<br/>
        FP stayed as a niche in mostly in acamedia until recently<br/>
        FP is still a niche today, but is arguably a mainstream niche<br/>
        For some, FP might seem intimidating due to its mathy roots<br/>

        <h1>What is the big deal about FP?</h1>
        Programs are made of functions<br/>
        Data "flows" through the program guided by functions<br/>
        Functions are not your typical OO methods. FP has a lot of neat tricks with its functions<br/>
        Notably, FP allows you to easily <b>compose</b> new functions based on existing ones<br/>
        <br/>
        Typical FP programs have less variables<br/>
        FP programs are often smaller in size than those of other paradigms<br/>
        FP programs can look cryptic at first, but the rules are simple<br/>

        <h1>Examples</h1>
        <a href="https://github.com/thachmai/fpTour/">https://github.com/thachmai/fpTour</a><br/>
        In this example, let's build a web page that retrieves information from Github API and shows it in a table format.<br/>

        <h1>FP Today</h1>
        Functional Programming is already here. It's affecting many design choices from popular languages.<br/>
        Learning directly the FP paradigm can help you to simplify the concepts.<br/>
        FP is rich in useful techniques<br/>
        <br/>
        Learning a new paradigm takes time. But for me, the FP journey has been most rewarding.<br/>
        I hope that you'll give it a try.<br/>
