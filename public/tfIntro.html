        <h1>Software Deployment Today</h1>
        Lots of choices: shell scripts, chef, puppet, ansible, salt, mesos...<br/>
        Indefinitely customizable and configurable, but can take lots of time.<br/> 
        Error handling is not easy.<br/>
        Configuration is not easy to automate, especially with the growing number of APIs from cloud providers.<br/>
        <br/>
        Deployment is still a pain for many organizations.<br/>

        <h1>Terraform</h1>
        My current project has ambitious goals for deployment: fully automated, fast, easily configurable.<br/>
        We're been testing <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">terraform</a> for a few months. The results are quite positive.<br/>
        Let's start with an example: I want an nginx on <a href="http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B00X9XCZQ2?ref_=gb1h_tit_c-2_7347_4d7ab569&smid=A1X6FK5RDHNB96">Digital Ocean</a>.<br/>
    </section>

    <section class="full">
        <pre>
variable "do_token" { default = "12e7ff309c07e9e8aee91e81214d4dfa653182a3e65c21d0df12c27b9b01a07f" }
variable "do_ssh_key" { default = "1200719" }

provider "digitalocean" { token = "${var.do_token}" }
resource "digitalocean_droplet" "meetup_nginx" {
    name = "nginx"
    image = "debian-8-x64"
    region = "fra1"
    size = "1gb"
    private_networking = "true"
    ssh_keys = ["${var.do_ssh_key}"]
    connection { key_file = "id_robot" }

    provisioner "remote-exec" {
        inline = [
            "apt-get update",
            "apt-get install -qy nginx"
        ]
    }
}
output "nginx_ip" { value = "${digitalocean_droplet.meetup_nginx.ipv4_address}" }
        </pre>

    <section>
        <h1>Terraform Main Concepts</h1>
        - <code>Resource</code>: something created by providers. Can be physical (VM, IP address) or logical (generated configuration file).<br/>
        - <code>Providers</code>: creators of resources. Many providers are supplied by default such as VMWare, Amazon, Google, Azure, DigitalOcean, OpenStack.<br/>
        - <code>Provisioners</code>: modifiers of resources such as command execution and file upload.<br/>
    </section>

    <section style="padding-top: 1em">
        <h1>The resource graph</h1>
        The resources must form a directed acyclic graph, meaning there is a start and end point for every path.<br/>
        Terraform plans its execution based on this graph. Parallel paths can be executed together.<br/>
        <img src="imgs/tf_aws_graph.png"/>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>How does it work?</h1>
        <code>terraform apply</code> reads <b>all</b> the *.tf files in the current directory. File ordering is not important.<br/>
        It then constructs the graph of the resources and executes the providers/provisioners following this graph.<br/>
        In case of error during the execution of a path, the resource is marked as <b>tainted</b> and the path is abandonned for the current run.<br/>
        Subsequent <code>terraform apply</code> will pick up on the failed path(s) and try them again.<br/>
        The deployment state is stored in .tfstate files. Don't lose them!
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>Other commands</h1>
        <code>terraform plan</code> to get an idea of how terraform will execute your deployment.<br/>
        <code>terraform graph</code> to get a GraphViz data of the plan.<br/>
        <code>terraform show</code> to get the current state of the deployment.<br/>
        <code>terraform destroy</code> to remove all the created resources.<br/>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>Why we like Terraform</h1>
        - Deployment script becomes simple (more configuration than scripting) and flexible (cloud deployment is a breeze).<br/>
        - The language is surprisingly simple but allows good composability.<br/>
        - Deployment plan becomes obvious.<br/>
        - Redimensioning your existing infrastructure is easy.<br/>
        - Terraform is a part of a coherent ecosystem from Hashicorp that goes beyond deployment.<br/>

    <section>
        <h1>Consul: cluster orchestration</h1>
        - At its core, Consul is a <a href="http://research.google.com/archive/chubby.html">Chubby</a> type "lock service" (or config store).<br/>
        - Similar to ZooKeeper, etcd, with some notable additions.<br/>
        - Built-in cluster orchestration and monitoring.<br/>
        - Built-in DNS server for service discovery.<br/>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>Packer: automated VM construction</h1>
        - Argument the capability of terraform by providing premade VMs ready for deployment.<br/>
        - Able to build VMs for a large number of cloud providers.<br/>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>The Hashicorp ecosystem</h1>
        - Excellent domain model, built by people who understand DevOps.<br/>
        - Unix philophophy: do one thing and one thing well.<br/>
        - Still not matured (pre-beta) but already show great promises.<br/>
        - Give it a try if you can, it might change the way you view DevOps.<br/>
